# 📱 Custos Mobile Application

This project is an Expo-based mobile application developed as part of the Custos initiative. It is designed to run cross-platform on iOS and Android devices, leveraging the Expo framework for simplified setup and development.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Expo**: A framework that allows for building cross-platform applications in React Native with ease.
- **React Native**: The primary framework used to create mobile applications that work on both iOS and Android.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used in this application.
- **React Navigation**: Handles routing and navigation within the app.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed (recommended version >= 14.x).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the app locally.

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Custos-Diretriz/custos-mobile.git
    cd custos-mobile
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the app**:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

   This command will open an Expo development environment. You can then open the app in:
   - A development build
   - An Android emulator or iOS simulator
   - Expo Go for a quick preview

4. **📂 File-based Routing**: You can start development by editing files within the `app` directory, as the project utilizes file-based routing.

## ✅ Running Tests Locally

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run Tests**:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

   This will run all test cases within the project, providing immediate feedback on the code quality and functionality.

## 📦 Dependencies

All dependencies are defined in the `package.json` file. Here are some key dependencies:

- **expo**: The Expo framework for React Native apps.
- **react-navigation**: For managing in-app navigation.
- **jest**: Used as the testing framework.

To install all dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🔄 Resetting the Project

To reset the project to its initial state:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command moves any existing starter code to the `app-example` directory and prepares a clean project setup.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
